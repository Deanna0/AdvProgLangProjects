## AdvProgLangProjects

*A collection of all the projects from my Advanced Programming Languages class*

**Image Processor** *(Assingment #1)* <br>
>C program takes in a grayscale image and has the functionality to rotate the image and generate a new image based on a pixel threshold value

**Haskell** *(Assignment #2)* <br>
>Haskell program was created to help me learn the fundamental concepts of functional programming through utilizing function definitions, pattern matching, recursion, folds, & lazy evaluation

**Employee Lookup in Prolog** *(Assignment #3)* <br>
>Prolog program takes information from an excel sheet of employee data spanning 14 different categories and streamlines the process of looking up employee data based on different categories

**MatLab GUI Application** *(Assignment #4)* <br>
>Multiple Matlab programs to generate various shapes were created and I compilied all of them into an application with a GUI so that a user can make their own shapes based on a predetermined list

**Image Processor in Python** *(Assignment #5)* <br>
>A Python wrapper script to combine multiple programming languages (Prolog, Haskell, Matlab, & C) to create an image processor that displays, creates a black and white version, inverts, and flips the original image upside
